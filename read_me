This project is a profile website with an about me page, porfolio, and contact.  It's HTML based with CSS integration. 
Using CSS from Bootstrap, I was able to make the website very functional, consistent, and aesthetically pleasing. 
Examples are the NavBar, Cards, and Grid. Which was used on all three pages.
