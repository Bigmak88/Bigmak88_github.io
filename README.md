### About Me
This is my profile website with an about me page, porfolio, and contact.  It's HTML based with CSS integration. 
Using CSS from Bootstrap, I was able to make the website very functional, consistent, and aesthetically appealing. 
The navbar includes the following pages:

* About Me (view for my bio)

* Portfolio (view for my work)

* Contact (form mail)

* **Deployable Link** - https://markkelly00.github.io/about/
